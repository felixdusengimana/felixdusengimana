<h1 align="">Hi there, I am <a href="https://phelixdusengimanaweb.vercel.app/" target="__blank">Felix DUSENGIMANA</a> 👋</h1>
<h3 align="">A passionate frontend developer from Rwanda <img width="26px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Flag_of_Rwanda.svg/1280px-Flag_of_Rwanda.svg.png"/></h3>

<p>I'm a high school student who lives in the Rwanda. I'm learning how to code. I love making and designing webpages with HTML and CSS and JavaScript. It's fun to code something that anyone on the web can easily see. I also enjoy programming in C++, Java and Python because they challenge me more. I love it when I can finally solve a difficult problem. For my programming projects, I usually only upload to Github once I make significant progress. For markdown files, I make commits much more often. Feel free to create a pull request to contribute to any of my repositories.
